Hi! I'm a first year Masters student at the Language Technologies Institute of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Yulia Tsvetkov] (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/), and my research interests lie in multilingual Natural Language Processing and interpretabile machine learning.
In May 2020, I graduated from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://wpi.edu) with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics.    

Outside of work I'll be drawing, listening to (lots of) music, reading, and staying active!
