Hi! I'm an undergraduate senior at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://wpi.edu) studying Computer Science and Mathematics.  My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction and machine learning (ML).  

In graduate school, I hope to explore multimodal ML applications for **personal health informatics** and **human behavior analysis**.
