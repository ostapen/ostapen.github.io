#content1: Johns Hopkins University’s Fifth Frederick Jelinek language technology workshop. I was in Dr. Lucia Specia’s multimodal machine translation team, where I helped develop deep, context-aware techniques which, given a captioned image, could use the image to resolve ambiguities when translating text. MMT was part of the Grounded Sequence to Sequence Transduction team, a larger effort to understand actions in instructional videos by aligning audio, visual data, and video transcriptions.
